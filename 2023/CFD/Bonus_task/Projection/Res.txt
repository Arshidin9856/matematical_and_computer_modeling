Solves the equation of interior fluid motion over a step.
This will simulate the inflow behavior into the pipe and the
boundary layer developing over time and space as well as the vortex
that is being created right after the step. The system of equations
is solved by Chorin`s Projection method and SIMPLE method.

u:  Velocity x component
v:  Velocity y component
p:  Pressure
meu:  Kinematic Viscosity
rho:  Density (here =1)
t:  Time
Re: Reynolds number (Re = 100 is equivalent to meu = 0.01)

Above the step, the flow is developing the Hagen-Poiseuille
profile, which is characteristic for pipe flow.

After the step, the flow adjusts to be over the entire 
crosssection of the pipe and develops the parabolic profile
over the wider diameter.

Towards the end of the domain, the flow is fully developed
and adheres to the outflow boundary condition.

The üîÑ indicates spot, in which vortices develop depending
on the investigated Reynolds Number.
